Industries.  We are very happy this week that you get to be a part of this discussion!  If you’ve been following along in the last week, there has been a discussion about the disruptions in other business sectors, and how this might be soon experienced in our own industry.  I have invited a pair of business leaders in on today’s broadcast, Mr. J. Mac Rust, and Mr. Landon Northcutt of Stephenville TX to discuss how a little organization that these gentlemen worked together to begin might become the game changer for a disruptive motion in the lab services sector. John: J.M. Rust, with On Campus Laboratories and Mr. Northcutt, with On Campus Lab Services, I am very thankful you’ve given us the opportunity to spend time with you today so that all of us will learn more about your company, On Campus Laboratory Services and the changes that its’ model will potentially cause to the laboratory testing sector.J. Mac Rust: Mr. Walker, you are very welcome!  We are pleased to join you.Landon Northcutt:  Yeah, John, we are grateful you have extended an invitation to the two of us to talk with you and your listeners.John:  How about the two of you explain to these followers some about On Campus Labs?J. Mac Rust: No problem Mr. Walker.  On Campus Laboratory, put simply is a organization that builds relationships between country hospitals and metropolitan doctors.John:  That seems easy to understand. So what does this connection look like?Landon Northcutt:  We discovered that clinics in metro regions were having to deal with a host of churn and burn lab testing for all of their laboratory tests and processing.  Usually these services was finished quickly, but accuracy was a factor, client service was tossed to the side, and it just wasn’t what it used to be.  Since the two of us grew up in a rural city an hour away from Fort Worth, TX, we noticed that there are a lot of hospitals in small towns near our area with millions of dollars of lab resources being unused simply because they do not have a sizable enough local census count in their area to really keep the hospital lab busy.J. Mac Rust: John, at the heart of it, we visualize our purpose of On Campus as connection points between the doctors and these small town hospital labs.  Our company provides services that includes the carrier between the doctor’s offices and the laboratory services locations.  We create relationships between these entities so that everyone wins: the hospital organizations see increased revenue from the lab services having more business to sustain it, the doctor’s offices are getting quality services by non-overworked employees that are in a more relaxed workspace, and the patients are receiving results back that have fewer mistakes, and this is happening in the same amount of time or less than it took before.John: Jay that is an thoughtful implication.  You’ve intimated that you have seen a unlikeness in quality by reason of it is a country lab analysis facility, instead of a metro laboratory testing facility.  Will you elaborate on that?Landon Northcutt:  Yeah Mr. Walker, Mac introduces a thoughtful implication.  What we have found is that in a lot of the DFW metropolitan region laboratory analysis facilities, they can be a churn and burn environs to work in.  They’re processing so many lab results a day, and their technicians are under the gun to meet quotas.  That type of environment as in any area of life creates stress.  This stress has shown an effect on the technicians, the service delivered, and the company itself.  Sequentially, that has shown an effect on the clinics ordering the laboratory tests, the person who is being treated, and the community at large.  We have learned that the low anxiety environment of many of our rural communities’ medical care facilities makes more peaceful workers.  These are staff that are well-educated and have the ability to use all of the same laboratory equipment that you’ll have in the metro, but their work environs isn’t the similar high turnover method.  With that in mind, they are capable to take the amount of time to be precise and follow procedures with less blunders.John:  Gentlemen, what is the mantra of On Campus Laboratory?J. Mac Rust: Partnering rural hospitals with progressive minded doctors.  That’s what we do.  John, we really think that it takes a forward thinking doctor or out of the box thinker (whatever you want to call it) to really get the beauty in the model.  BUT, we really believe that as many more doctor’s offices are discovering new options, their modus operandi will most likely be changed to this way of doing things simply because of necessity for doing things differently.Landon Northcutt: Let us not be misunderstood here Mr. Walker.  We are not suggesting that rural hospital lab analysis facilities are going to take over and laboratory analysis facilities in metro areas are going to see a large drop in business.  We are simply stating that this is a workable alternate that more and more doctors need to turn to as we go onward.  There’s plenty of room in the playground for all involved to capably play nicely and everyone have their piece of the action.John: Quickly, tell the listeners more about this OCL.  What kinds of services does On Campus Laboratory Management LLC provide?J. Mac Rust: Our lab services is composed of: Wellness Blood Testing, Blood Allergy Testing, Pharmacogenetics Testing, Respiratory Pathogen Panels, and Toxicology Panels.John: You have the ability to cover most lab services that are being ordered?Landon Northcutt:  Close, Mr. Walker.  There are some test that we haven’t jumped in to yet, mainly because the demand on a local level is very small and the machines for these laboratories can be cost prohibitive.  There is not a need to buy a piece of equipment that is not going to turn a profit for a very long time when you know doctors are not likely to be sending in orders for lab tests that will mean requiring the ownership of those machines.John: Mac, Shall we get back to where we started, will you be using this to take over the world?J. Mac Rust:  Landon, do you want to take this one?  LOL.  Just kidding.  No, Mr. Walker, at this moment, we are just spending time on solving messes in this industry in Texas.  Beyond a doubt, we do see how this model could make changes to the industry in each region, and we have no doubt that other companies are going to figure out how to make it happen in their states and regions.  Texas is a giant piece of the pie.  We have got our schedules filled up with this project at the moment and for the foreseeable future.John:  Okay Mac and Landon, thank you for taking the time with me and indulging me and the audience in these questions.J. Mac Rust: You are definitely welcome John.  Many thanks for having us.Landon Northcutt: Yes, Mr. Walker.  Many thanks for bringing us on.John: We are looking forward to learning more about your business and discovering what lies up the road for your business.  Once again, much gratitude for the time you spent with us.landon northcutt attorney stephenvillelandon northcutt attorney stephenville txlandon northcutt lawyer stephenvillelandon northcutt lawyer stephenville txjay mac rust diversified sales llcjay mac rust on campus laboratoryjay mac rust star hospital solutionsjay mac rust star management solutionsj. mac rust diversified sales llcj. mac rust on campus laboratoryj. mac rust star hospital solutionsj. mac rust star management solutionsjay rust diversified sales llcjay rust on campus laboratoryjay rust star hospital solutionsjay rust star management solutionsmac rust diversified sales llcmac rust on campus laboratorymac rust star hospital solutionsmac rust star management solutionslandon northcutt diversified sales llclandon northcutt on campus laboratorylandon northcutt star hospital solutionslandon northcutt star management solutionsshane bledsoe diversified sales llcshane bledsoe on campus laboratoryshane bledsoe star hospital solutionsshane bledsoe star management solutionsjay mac rust and shane bledsoej. mac rust and shane bledsoejay rust and shane bledsoemac rust and shane bledsoelandon northcutt and shane bledsoeOn Campus Labs was formed due to an incredible need in the field of lab services.
